# Student Grade Manager

A modern, responsive, and single-page web application for managing student grades. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a clean interface for adding students, tracking their performance across multiple subjects, and viewing overall class statistics. The application uses `localStorage` for persistent data storage, so your data is saved in your browser even after closing the tab.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Dynamic Two-Step Form:** Easily add a new student by first entering their name, unique roll number, and the number of subjects. The form then dynamically generates fields to enter each subject and its corresponding grade.
* **Comprehensive Student List:** View all students in a clean, responsive table that shows their roll number, name, a detailed list of subjects with grades, and their calculated average grade.
* **Live Class Statistics:** Get instant insights with a dedicated statistics panel displaying:
    * Total number of students.
    * Overall class average.
    * The average score of the top-performing student.
* **Real-time Search:** Instantly filter the student list by searching for a student's name or roll number.
* **Persistent Data:** All student data is saved to the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that your information is not lost when you refresh or close the page.
* **Data Integrity:** Includes robust validation to ensure that roll numbers are unique and grades are within a valid range (0-100).
* **Legacy Data Migration:** Automatically detects and converts data from previous, outdated formats to the current structure, preventing errors from old `localStorage` entries.
* **Sleek & Responsive Design:** Features a modern dark theme with a visually appealing layout that works seamlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
