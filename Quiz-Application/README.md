# Interactive Quiz Application

A stylish and dynamic web-based quiz application that fetches questions from a live API. This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and API integration.

## üìú Description

This project is an interactive quiz that presents users with 15 multiple-choice questions fetched from the Open Trivia Database. The application provides immediate visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers, tracks the user's score, and displays the final result at the end. The "Play Again" feature allows for endless replayability with a new set of questions each time.

The primary goal was to build a complete, self-contained web application without relying on any external frameworks, demonstrating core web development skills.
