#Student Grade Manager
A modern, responsive, and single-page web application for managing student grades. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a clean interface for adding students, tracking their performance across multiple subjects, and viewing overall class statistics. The application uses localStorage for persistent data storage, so your data is saved in your browser even after closing the tab.

#✨ Features
Dynamic Two-Step Form: Easily add a new student by first entering their name, unique roll number, and the number of subjects. The form then dynamically generates fields to enter each subject and its corresponding grade.

Comprehensive Student List: View all students in a clean, responsive table that shows their roll number, name, a detailed list of subjects with grades, and their calculated average grade.

Live Class Statistics: Get instant insights with a dedicated statistics panel displaying:

Total number of students.

Overall class average.

The average score of the top-performing student.

Real-time Search: Instantly filter the student list by searching for a student's name or roll number.

Persistent Data: All student data is saved to the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your information is not lost when you refresh or close the page.

Data Integrity: Includes robust validation to ensure that roll numbers are unique and grades are within a valid range (0-100).

Legacy Data Migration: Automatically detects and converts data from previous, outdated formats to the current structure, preventing errors from old localStorage entries.

Sleek & Responsive Design: Features a modern dark theme with a visually appealing layout that works seamlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
